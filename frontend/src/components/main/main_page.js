        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>TransClinique’s medical practice provides telemedicine-based clinical services for transgender individuals, as well as others who identify as non-cisgender. We also welcome all members of the LGBT community. TransClinique employs, when possible, physicians, psychologists and other healthcare providers who identify as transgender themselves, or those who have otherwise established excellence in caring for transgender patients. This includes professionals who qualify as “gender identity specialists” for the purpose of supporting hormonal therapy and screening for trans-associated surgeries.</p>

        <h2>Our Process</h2>
        <h3>Why Telemedicine?</h3>
        <p>Trans-specific healthcare delivered via telemedicine has important advantages for transgender patients who may not have easy access to knowledgeable providers near their homes. The tools of telemedicine, including not only videoconferencing but also online lab test requisitions and results delivery, long-distance electronic pharmacy access, electronic record-keeping and legal access across state lines are now sufficiently advanced to make telehealth specialization in transgender medicine practical across much of the U.S. Trans-specific healthcare delivered via telemedicine also offers convenience, safety and privacy. Importantly, all of our Providers are trans themselves, thus allowing for more comfortable visits discussing issues that are often difficult to relate to for some other healthcare providers.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Anyone with a smartphone, laptop, tablet or desktop computer will be able to apply through the patient portal and receive telemedicine based care.</li>
            <li>Laboratory tests will be ordered through one of several national labs with local blood draw facilities, and prescriptions can be sent directly to your pharmacy from TransClinique.</li>
            <li>Although the majority of your visits will be virtual, our practice plans to staff pop-up clinics in major cities throughout the year, where we hope to give you an opportunity to meet the TransClinique team in person.</li>

        <h3>For Our Hormone Replacement Therapy Patients</h3>

            <div class="steps"><span class="step">Step</span> <span class="step-number">1</span></div>
            <h3 class="blue">Initial Consultation <br />With TransClinique</h3>
            <p>Your first visit will entail a full medical history and discussion of your gender journey thus far. The appropriateness and goals of Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) will be carefully considered. We will review the medication(s), side effects, risks and benefits of treatment, laboratory monitoring, and frequency of follow up visits. This visit will be a 60 minute consultation. In most cases this visit will be via telemedicine. Transclinique operates on an Informed Consent Model meaning that we can start medications without a therapist visit. However, we have strong mental health providers under the TransClinique umbrella available to help you navigate this challenging portion of your life. Routine screening at your initial visit for depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, eating disorders, substance abuse, intimate partner violence, self-injury, high-risk sexual behaviors and suicidality will be provided.</p>

            <div class="steps"><span class="step">Step</span> <span class="step-number">2</span></div>
            <h3>Laboratory Tests</h3>
            <p>We will need to check your hormone levels, liver and kidney function before starting any kind of HRT. If you would like to get your lab testing prior to your first visit, you may contact us beforehand and ask us to submit a lab order. By ordering your lab tests prior to your first visit you may be able to expedite the process of beginning your treatment. This will need to be done at the nearest lab facility near you which we can help you locate. The order for the appropriate blood tests will be waiting for your arrival.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="step3">
            <div class="steps"><span class="step">Step</span> <span class="step-number">3</span></div>
            <h3>Hormone Therapy</h3>
            <p>Once your full medical evaluation is complete and all of your questions have been addressed, you will be eligible to begin hormone therapy. During the first year of HRT therapy, you will need blood tests every three months in order for us to follow your levels closely. We will start with a small dose and carefully monitor your body’s response. Assuming your lab work is satisfactory, we can then increase your dose. This usually will take about 6-12 months to stabilize. Typically patients require four visits the first year and twice a year after that. Follow-up visits are usually 20 minutes.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="note">
            <h3>Please Note</h3>
            <p>State laws requiring patients receiving testosterone treatment to have at least one in-person appointment prior to starting HRT have been temporarily suspended due to the recent COVID-19 outbreak. If this changes we can accomodate you through one of our many of our planned Pop-Up Clinics, although special considerations and meetings can also usually be arranged.</p>
