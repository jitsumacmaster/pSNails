                  TransClinique’s medical practice provides telemedicine-based clinical services for 
                  transgender individuals, as well as others who identify as non-cisgender. We also welcome
                  all members of the LGBT community. TransClinique employs, when possible, physicians, 
                  psychologists and other healthcare providers who identify as transgender themselves, 
                  or those who have otherwise established excellence in caring for transgender patients. 
                  This includes professionals who qualify as “gender identity specialists” for the purpose 
                  of supporting hormonal therapy and screening for trans-associated surgeries.

                <p>
                  Jitsu is a Biologist by training and a Software Developer by trade. She studied Intergrative Biology at UC Berkeley. 
                  Like all students at Berkeley, she wished for a world where her work could make a positive social impact, but she settled 
                  for organic chemistry and midterms. After spending time in managerial roles in the software industry, she 
                  recognized how much potential even well developed technologies could still be leveraged to benefit people and 
                  not just corporations &amp; shareholders. She learned computer programing and became a Software Developer skilled with 
                  JavaScript, MERN Stack, Ruby, Rails, React-Redux, jQuery, SQL, as well as several acronyms. 
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
                  Now she manages the web space for the amazing site that you're on right now(!!) as well as other pro-social charities 
                  and non-profits.
