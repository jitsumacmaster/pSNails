            <h3>Insurance</h3>
            <p>
                If you have existing insurance it very likely will cover the cost of the medications we 
                prescribe and sometimes the labs. If your labs are not covered under your insurance plan then 
                I recommend joining the TransClinique silver or gold plan as it will be the most affordable for you.
