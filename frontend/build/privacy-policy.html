This Website is owned and operated by Alexis Petra MD PLLC, d/b/a TransClinique Compression ("TransClinique," "us," "our," or "we"). This Privacy Policy, along with our Terms &amp; Conditions, explains how we gather and use your information as it relates to your activities on this Website. If you use this Website, you consent to our collection, use, and disclosure of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. We may change this policy without notice, and your use signifies that you agree to be bound by any changes. </p><p><strong>1. How we collect information about you<br><em>A. We may collect technical information.</em></strong><br>Our Website's server and management system routinely collects information about the origin and site navigation of visitors to this Website. This data might include technical information (e.g., your processor type, processor speed, operating system type, browser type, audio devices, modem devices, video cards, page views, and protocol address). Collected technical information is not linked to any of your personal identifying information. TransClinique may use this information to manage or modify this Website.<br><br><strong><em>B. We may collect personal information.</em></strong><br>TransClinique only collects personally identifiable information if you expressly provide it to us. <br><br><strong><em>C. We may use cookies.</em></strong><br>We may use cookies to collect anonymized information about how our visitors use this Website. This allows us to improve the Website and personalize your visit experience. Cookies are small data text files that are sent from a server computer to your computer during a web browsing session. The cookies are typically stored on your computer's hard drive, and websites use them to simulate a continuous connection to that site and to allow a computer to automatically identify your browser when you visit the website. Some browsers automatically accept cookies, but you may be able to prevent cookies by changing your browser's settings. If you disable cookies, it may impair your ability to use some features of this Website. Please visit www.allaboutcookies.org if you want to learn more about cookies. </p><p><strong>2. How we use your information.<br><em>A. We may use personally identifiable information.</em></strong><br>TransClinique may use personally identifiable information that you share with us as follows. We may use it: (1) if you elect to receive information about TransClinique's programs, items, or services, to provide you with such information, including for our own marketing and promotional materials; (2) to improve this Website; and (3) to create non-personal summary or aggregate data for business analysis, market analysis, communications management, research, planning, and other lawful purposes. We will never sell or lease your information.<br><br><strong><em>B. You may opt-out of communications from us.</em></strong><br>If you no longer wish to receive our marketing or promotional communications, please contact us with your request. We will respect your wish to opt-out of communications.</p><p><strong>3. Do not provide us with your PHI.<br><em>A. We take confidentiality and privacy seriously.</em></strong><br>Our Privacy Policy details how TransClinique approaches the confidentiality of its visitors and clients. We take our responsibility to protect the privacy of your information seriously. However, because this Website is not intended to transmit or store protected health information ("PHI"), TransClinique's activities as they relate to this Website may not comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ("HIPAA"). The protections extended to our practice's records and data are not necessarily extended to non-PHI-related information shared or transmitted on this Website, unless expressly stated otherwise.<br><br><strong><em>B. We have no affirmative duty to monitor the information that you provide.</em></strong><br>Other than as necessary to schedule an appointment or submit an inquiry through any HIPAA-compliant third-party vendor's portal, it is important that you not use, provide, transmit, store, or disclose any PHI through our Website. We have no affirmative duty to monitor the sensitivity or type of the data that you might provide, transmit, store, or disclose while using this Website. If we have actual knowledge that you are using, providing, transmitting, storing, or disclosing PHI through our Website, we may revoke your access to the Website and its Content.<br><br><strong><em>C. You indemnify us against damages from your sharing of PHI.</em></strong><br>If you use, provide, transmit, store, or disclose PHI in connection with this Website or the Content (in violation of this Privacy Policy and our Terms &amp; Conditions), you agree to indemnify TransClinique against any damages, losses, liabilities, judgments, costs, or expenses (including reasonable attorney fees and costs) arising out such use, provision, transmission, storage, or disclosure of PHI.</p><p><strong>4. This Website is not intended for children under the age of 18.</strong><br>This Website is not intended or designed to attract children under the age of eighteen, and we do not collect personally identifiable information from any person whom we know to be under the age of eighteen. If we inadvertently come to possess personally identifiable information about a child under the age of eighteen, we will not knowingly disclose that information to any third party.</p><p><strong>5. Security of third-party Websites.</strong><br>TransClinique may provide links in this Website to unaffiliated third-party websites. If you follow these links, you demonstrate your agreement that we are not responsible for and do not control the information on these websites. Prior to following any third-party link, you should review that website's privacy policy and terms of use, as your visit to the website may bind you to those third-party terms and policies. </p><p><strong>6. How we monitor social media.</strong><br>TransClinique may be active on social media, and we encourage your participation in our social media channels. This may include our blog(s), Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, YouTube, LinkedIn, and other channels (collectively, our "social media"). We may expand or narrow our available social media channels without notice, and this policy applies to our activities on any social media outlet, on this Website, and on those websites and social media accounts that you access through our affiliates. <br><br><strong><em>A. Our social media activity does not constitute health advice.</em></strong><br>Our social media postings and content do not constitute medical or healthcare advice, and they are not a substitute for the advice of a licensed healthcare professional who is familiar with your health history. Even if the posting user is a licensed healthcare professional, their comments should not be construed as personal health advice. If you have a medical concern, you should always personally consult with a healthcare provider. Please contact us directly to schedule an appointment. In an emergency, you should call 911. <br><br><strong><em>B. We prohibit certain content on our social media.</em></strong><br>Your activity on TransClinique's social media is public, and information shared on social media often cannot be un-shared. Your decision to post something may be irrevocable, or incapable of being undone. Please be cautious to not disclose personally identifiable information, such as your location, medical history, or financial information.<br><br>Accordingly, you alone are responsible for your activity on TransClinique's social media. You specifically agree not to: (1) misrepresent yourself or use another person's identity; (2) engage in harassment, defamation, personal attacks, spam, offensive content, or illegal activities; or (3) publish illegal, obscene, defamatory, threatening, unlawful, disruptive, profane, harassing, or abusive content.<br><br><strong><em>C. We have no duty to monitor our social media accounts.</em></strong><br>TransClinique may, but has no affirmative duty to, oversee its social media accounts.
